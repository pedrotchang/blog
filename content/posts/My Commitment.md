Today was the day (writing a day later), where I purchased my Kubestronaut Exam Certificates.

I paid exactly $822.50 for all 5 cerificates. Phew.

I am not in an amazing financial space. These are going on the credit card. Well, to be honest,
my wife's credit card.

I don't talk much about my finances. It isn't the most fun conversation. But my dear wife,
who I do not know where I would be without, sees something in me that I also have a hard time
seeing.

I spoke these words, "This is the last time you have to do this". And I meant it. When I end these
certificates, I am going to become a Kubestronaut, and with it, open the doors for that job that
I need, and hopefully, deserve.

This wasn't an easy post, but 1 that is needed.

It is always fun and exciting, but I am in this for the long haul.

As a wise man once said, "I made it my life's goal to have a career in tech" (not word for word!).

I hope you will enjoy this blog, and even maybe in the future some courses that we create together!

We, because, it is a conversation! It wouldn't exist without a *potential* reader.
