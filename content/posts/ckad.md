Long story short, since this *is* a Blog, albeit with an emphasis on technology
here are some updates.

The family and I had to get out of "dodge", even though that place was our home.
We were staying in a community in Los Angeles, that although has *now* a no
smoking policy, it did not in the past. Due to this little loop-hole, our
neighbor during that stay, basically smoked 24/7 (probably more like 8-10 hours)
a day. As much as I want to be that cool neighbor, not being able to leave or
open your window due to that cripling fear of, will my place smell like
cigarettes when I get back, was just plain no fun.

We tried our best to address this throughout our stay in our apartment complex,
and after about 6 months, they got back to a solution: move out, and move in to
another unit "free" of penalty.

So we did that, but the only feasible unit we found was only open a month later.
Instead of staying any longer, the family and I decided to leave the city, and
actually the whole country all together, and stay in an AirBnb in Jeju, South
Korea!

My time there, I decided to just take the time study as much as possible.

When I arrived, I think I was about 60% done with my Certified Kubernetes
Administrator (CKA) certificate, (yes, I know this article is about the CKAD)
which actually...the later 40% took a lot longer than I had hoped.

With so many things going on, family, new location, etc., I decided to sort of
*rush* the process. I had hoped to finish a lot more during my stay there, but
I definitely overestimated my capabilities, and underestimated the tests.

I don't have an extensive Linux background. Don't get me wrong, I set up Arch,
and use it only a regular basis, but not a background that requires me to
be an administrator such as a *job* (if anyone is hiring, I am interested fyi).
This means asides from studying for these tests, I was learning more commands.

A lot more.

So I finished my studies, (yay), only to find that when I went in to take my
CKA, I had a ton of technical difficulties. Make sure you get a decent external
camera, a decent dongle, a good keyboard, and a good mouse. If you use Mac, opt
to *not* use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard!

Now you might think that reaching the Linux Foundation support is quick and
easy. Not at all! It takes time, in fact 3-5 days, of which I did not want to
spend sitting on my hands.

Now, after some studying and taking time to prepare for the CKAD, I am now a
Certified Kubernetes Application Developer!

I will say that the CKAD required a lot more knowledge around the imperative
commands, and *knowing* which one's do not have, such as NetworkPolicies.
