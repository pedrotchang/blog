# Contract for Certificates

## Introduction

This is what I plan to do while I am in South Korea in the month of May and
June.

I will fly out of LAX on the 7th of May and will arrive on the 8th. We will
probably take about 3 days to settle due to our financial situation.

I will also run every morning before studying except on Saturdays.
At minimum >=1 mile a day.

Rest days start Friday night and will end Saturday nights.

Nights I will meditate for 40 minutes.

## What a day should look like:

| Activity | Time |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Run | 6:00 - 7:00 |
| Study | 8:00 - 12:00 |
| Lunch | 12:00 - 13:00 |
| Study | 13:00 - 17:00 |
| Dinner | 17:00 - 18:30 |
| Meditate | 19:20 - 20:00 |
