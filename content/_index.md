# The Curious Engineer

Welcome, my name is Pedro, an aspiring Cloud Native Engineer from Los Angeles.

In this website, I share my thoughts and learnings predominantly about technical topics such 
as Kubernetes, Linux, DevOps, and Cloud Native Technologies. I personally have a lot of interests, 
so although most topics will be predominantly about tech, I hope to branch out to some side topics 
following the idea of a ["T-shaped"](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQH-1HGN4mwBNA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1677413431266?e=1746057600&v=beta&t=iSpOjaHI6vPP93ZGMJdQ_YrdrV_5pDlwNR6ExyBS6M4) approach.

I am big on Neovim, Zettelkasten, and any other technical study techniques or thinking methodologies 
that help me to become more efficient and improve in my output and, hopefully, contribute to humanity's 
collective wellbeing.
