In 2017, I, by happenstance, read [Goodbye, Things](https://www.amazon.com/Goodbye-Things-New-Japanese-Minimalism/dp/0393609030) and went on a journey on becoming an extreme minimalist for 2 years. I got rid of all my posessions,
and had only 20 pieces of clothing, and slept on a thin sleeping mattress. It was an amazing experience,
and now, as much as I thought it would be for life, it taught me some valuable lessons, and the importance
of keeping things from "possessing" me. 

Now as a father, I can no longer live in that way, but the theory and methodologies still live in my 
every day life. Therefore, I am sure you will see it manifest in how I write, and how I setup my 
technology structures.

I think it was said, "If something is too complex to be used, then it's unnecssary".

That being said, I like to use *minimalism* as my baseline method of applying tech.
