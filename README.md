# Introduction

I finally took the time to structure my blog.

It will mostly be Zetels that I build up to make a larger in depth article on my Substack.

Hey, I'm on Substack! Come follow me as I traverse all the rabitt holes found in tech.

(*Maybe* not all...but some, and as I pride myself to being weird, I am sure we will come up with some interesting things)

## What's Next

Nothing! At least not here, so if you'd like to give me me a holer, follow me or schedule a meeting!

Book a Meeting with me!
